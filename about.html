    <h1> Welcome to my Page!</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Yashaswini Mandalam, feel free to call me Yash. I am going to be a sophomore at URI this fall 2021. I am majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in programmming.
         I love creating things wether it be tangiable or intangiable. I like to sew, do DIY projects, bake and paint. I also like writing code, doing 3D creation projets and seeing my vision come to 
        life on a computer screen. I moved to Rhode Island from India five years ago and have been studying here ever since. I hope to build my coding skills so I can open myself to creating new 
        things. </p>
